# Overview

## I. Standard version of the service web site:

Currently, the standard version of Huang1111 Drive service is available at: [https://pan.huang1111.cn](https://pan.huang1111.cn)



## II. About the free default space:

As we confirmed to the Microsoft Commissioner that Microsoft officials are currently clearing out global tenants who use a large amount of traffic and will not provide unblocking, our user group is very large, so it is very easy to be cleared out by Microsoft at a later stage, so Huang1111 Drive will no longer provide Microsoft space as the default space to use from February 17th, 2025, and we will provide all users with default _**Huang1111 self-build space**_, but due to cost reasons, we adjusted the free user space capacity to 15GB, users can freely choose the [price model](../huang1111-self-build-space/price-models.md) for expansion.



## III. On value-added services:

When the value-added service you purchased expires, you will receive a prompt email from the system, the prompt email will remind you that the service has expired and the space capacity exceeds the upper limit, you can choose to clean up the space capacity or renew the value-added service, and the system will limit the account after 14 days, if the account is limited, please contact us through the feedback channel and we will unblock the account.
