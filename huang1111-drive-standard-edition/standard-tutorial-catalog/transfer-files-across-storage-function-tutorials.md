# Transfer files across storage function tutorials

In order to facilitate you to transfer files across storage, you can enable the Transfer files across storage function after purchasing the self-build space Rights Packages, and transfer files directly from the previously uploaded Microsoft storage to Huang1111 self-build storage.

The transfer process may be unstable due to network factors, so the transfer of some files may not be transferred, it is recommended to try a few more times (due to Microsoft's requirements for some formats of the file, it may not be able to automate the transfer of such files need to be manually transferred)

Be sure to make sure you transfer to self-built storage after purchase, the transfer process does not start automatically after purchase, but rather the automated transfer starts after you manually click Transfer.

## Transfer operation: Right-click the folder/file after entering the main interface, select “Migrate storage policy”, and then you can start the transfer after confirming.
