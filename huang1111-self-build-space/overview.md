huang1111 self-build space is formed by our deep-rooted server network for many years to provide users with high-performance, large-bandwidth storage space at a good price. huang1111 self-build space is different from the free space we provided in the past (Microsoft space), which does not have any API call limitations, is suitable for any form of file use, and relies on our huge server network. Its first support for remote downloads, transfer files across storage, direct links and many other features, the following is a brief comparison:
