# Remote Download Tutorials

After purchasing the self-build space Rights Packages, the netbook will automatically open the Remote Download function for the account, so that you can directly import data from the third-party Drives that supports the direct link to the Huang1111 self-build storage.

Remote Download function is mainly used to download files for users and transfer files across storage, which greatly facilitates the waiting time for users to transfer data and download files, and the whole process is automatically executed by the server without the need for users to operate manually.

Remote Download currently supports downloading via magnet chain/URL, with a maximum of two simultaneous download tasks.

## Remote Download operation: Enter the main interface, right click, select “new remote download”, submit the corresponding link to start automatic download.
